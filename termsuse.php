*In Our Code World we like to make everything simple, therefore in case you want to comment in our articles, be sure that your comment doesn't broke our really simple guidelines. It’s not meant to be comprehensive, rather focusing on the most commonly shared principles we believe are critical for setting a foundation in a community to enable it to thrive.

*Help Our Code World (and yourself in a future) by following the next common-sense rules:

<h2>Basic Rules</h2>
<h4>Stay On-topic</h4>

*Be sure your topic matches the general theme of the Article. For example, you can't talk about Cats or Dogs inside a JavaScript article, please don't.

<h2>Moderate Self-promotion</h2>

*Some code sample, open source project or comment that contains help and is related to the theme of the article, can be without a problem shared with the community in the comment box. However, a comment with only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site that has nothing to do with the theme of the article will be removed.

<h4>Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely</h4>

*Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame will always be removed.

<h4>Don’t Be a Jerk</h4>

*Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed.

<h4>Don’t Copy and Paste</h4>

*If you didn’t write it, or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post it.

<h4>English Only</h4>

*We currently only support English-only discussions on http://ourcodeworld.com. Non-English comments and discussions will be removed.
